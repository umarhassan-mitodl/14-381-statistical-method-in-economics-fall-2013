This course is divided into two sections, Part I and Part II.  Part I, found here, provides an introduction to statistical theory. A brief review of probability will be given mainly as background material, however, it is assumed to be known. Topics include normal distribution, limit theorems, Bayesian concepts, and testing, among others. 

Part II prepares students for the remainder of the econometrics sequence and and can be found by visiting [14.381 Fall 2006](/courses/14-381-statistical-method-in-economics-fall-2006).
