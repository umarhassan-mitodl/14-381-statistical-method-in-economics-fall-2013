Text
----

The text, which will be followed closely, is {{% resource_link "dc3539a6-bc2d-4090-89e6-87cf8b97334a" "![Buy at Amazon](/images/a_logo_17.gif)" %}} Casella, George, and Roger L. Berger. _Statistical Inference_. Cengage Learning, 2001. ISBN: 9780534243128.

This book covers all of the material of the course and, in addition, provides many problems for practice as well as excellent references.

Grading
-------

There will be a midterm (worth 35%). There will be 6 problem sets. This will constitute 15% of the grade. The solution to this problem will be posted after the due date. No late assignments will be accepted. All other problems are for your own study; the solutions to them won't be posted, but will be discussed during the sections. One problem from the problem sets will appear on the mid-term exam.
